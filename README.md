This is the code written for the different statistical measures of similairties that were used in the thesis "Hellinger Distance-based 
Similarity Measures for Recommender Systems.

The idea is to test how Hellinger distance preformes compared to other, more conventional measures. The results were underwhelming. Hellinger distance took
days to calculate, compared to minutes from other measures, while the perfromance wasnt improving.
